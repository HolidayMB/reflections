For the first week I chose to write about the Dream minecraft speedrunning drama. This is an interesting case where looking at data helped disprove a speedruns validity. Luck plays a part in minecraft speedruns, spesifically for item drop rates and piglin barter odds. If you have better luck for these aspects of the game, you will be able to complete more runs, and be on good pace more often.

The drama started after Dream, a popular minecraft youtuber submited a 3rd place run to the speedrun.com leaderboards. When moderators looked into that run and others attempted by Dream on stream, they noticed something odd. It seemed that Dream had incredible luck when it came to blaze rod drop rates (50% chance to drop when killing a blaze) and ender pearl barters (~5% chance per gold traded). Here is some the data on both senarios
