This is a map that shows American voters by population and by land. I think it's a very interesting visual because it offers both views, that paint a somewhat conflicting view. I never realized how sparse our population was out west, and the sheer concentration of people around both the east and west coasts. Plus it's interesting looking at what regions vote for what party. I'm not too political but it is definitely fun to learn about, and this map definitely helps do so.
